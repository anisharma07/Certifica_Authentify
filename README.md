- Certifica_Authentify aims to create a decentralized system that aims to eradicate the problem of document forging, which involves submitting counterfeit educational and other certificates, by proposing a reliable method to store and authenticate the certificates in real time to minimize the latency in the current authentication system and at the same time facilitating corrections in the certificates without physically reaching out to the concerned organization.This project proposes verifying the certificates using QR codes on the Ethereum blockchain to address certificate verification challenges.Solidity based Smart contracts are fully tested and  are utilized to automate and enforce the verification process. Transparent and Immutable nature of blockchain is leveraged to build a fully secure and robust system. It allows authorized users to add, delete and update certificates using their public key which denies the probability of any kind of fraud from the issuer’s side while allowing users to generate and scan qr codes and receive instant verification feedback.
